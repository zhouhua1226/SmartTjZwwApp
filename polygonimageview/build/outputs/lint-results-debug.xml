        severity="Error"
        message="This support library should not use a different version (22) than the `compileSdkVersion` (25)"
        category="Correctness"
        priority="8"
        summary="Incompatible Gradle Versions"
        explanation="There are some combinations of libraries, or tools and libraries, that are incompatible, or can lead to bugs. One such incompatibility is compiling with a version of the Android support libraries that is not the latest version (or in particular, a version lower than your `targetSdkVersion`.)"

    <issue
        id="GradleDependency"
        severity="Warning"
        message="A newer version of com.android.support:support-annotations than 22.1.1 is available: 25.3.1"
        category="Correctness"
        priority="4"
        summary="Obsolete Gradle Dependency"
        explanation="This detector looks for usages of libraries where the version you are using is not the current stable release. Using older versions is fine, and there are cases where you deliberately want to stick with an older version. However, you may simply not be aware that a more recent version is available, and that is what this lint check helps find."
